            This was one of the best and I decided to have it be the inspiration for my first assignment!</p>

            I like to think I am pretty okay at it too! I was lucky enough when I first went back to school, that a close friend of my wifes needed a logo designed for her and her husbands 
            company! Cardinal Woodworks was the first and when that was finished, the friends mother loved it so much she wanted me to rebrand her husbands logo for his painting company,
            Quality Coatings, and design a logo for her and her new company she was starting called Timeless Accents. Below you will see those three logos!</li>
   <li>I also recently started designing Youtube thumbnails for a friend of mine at church. He is big into card collecting and decided to share it on the internet and I offered to help!</li>
